# Implementation Planning

When implementing new features or making significant changes to the Reliquary application, you should create a detailed implementation plan:

## Implementation Plan Structure

- Follow the structure outlined in the [Implementation Plan Structure](../../Plans/implementation_plan_structure.md) document
- This document provides a template and guidelines for creating comprehensive implementation plans
- All implementation plans should be stored in the `Plans/` directory

## When to Create an Implementation Plan

- For new features that affect multiple components
- For significant refactoring efforts
- For changes to core functionality
- For features that will be implemented over multiple sprints

## Example Implementation Plan

- See the [Translation Implementation Plan](../../Plans/translation_implementation_plan.md) for a complete example
- Use this as a reference when creating your own implementation plans

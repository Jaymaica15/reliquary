# Implementation Plan Structure for Reliquary Application

This document outlines the recommended structure for creating implementation plans for the Reliquary application. Following this structure ensures consistency across different implementation efforts and provides a clear roadmap for development.

## Plan Structure

### 1. Title and Overview

```markdown
# [Feature/Component] Implementation Plan for Reliquary Application

This document outlines the detailed plan for implementing [feature/component] in the Reliquary application. [Brief description of what the feature is and its purpose].

[Include any high-level requirements or constraints here]
```

### 2. General Setup

This section should outline any infrastructure, configuration, or prerequisite work needed before implementing the specific feature components.

```markdown
## General Setup

Before implementing specific components, we need to set up the necessary infrastructure:

1. **[Setup Task 1]**
   ```bash
   # Include any relevant commands
   ```

2. **[Setup Task 2]**
   - [Subtask details]
   - [More subtask details]

3. **[Configuration Updates]**
   - [Configuration file changes]
   - [Environment variable requirements]
```

### 3. Component-Specific Implementation Plans

Break down the implementation by logical components (controllers, services, etc.). For each component:

```markdown
## Component-Specific Implementation Plans

### 1. [Component Name]

#### Files to Update:
- `[file path 1]`
- `[file path 2]`
- `[file path 3]`

#### [Resource/Configuration Keys] (if applicable):
```yaml
# Example configuration or resource definition
component:
  key1: 'Value 1'
  key2: 'Value 2'
  nested:
    subkey1: 'Nested Value 1'
```

#### Implementation Steps:
1. [Detailed step 1]
   ```php
   // Example code if applicable
   ```

2. [Detailed step 2]
   ```twig
   {# Example template code if applicable #}
   ```
```

### 4. Implementation Timeline

   ```php
   // Example code for using the feature in PHP
   ```

2. **[Context 2]**
   ```twig
   {# Example code for using the feature in Twig templates #}
   ```
```

### 7. Maintenance Considerations

Document ongoing maintenance requirements and considerations:

```markdown
## Maintenance Considerations

1. **[Consideration Category 1]**
   - [Maintenance task 1]
   - [Maintenance task 2]
   - [Best practice 1]

2. **[Consideration Category 2]**
   - [Maintenance task 1]
   - [Maintenance task 2]
   - [Best practice 1]

3. **[Future Enhancements]**
   - [Potential enhancement 1]
   - [Potential enhancement 2]
```

## Example Implementation Plan

Below is a simplified example of how this structure would be applied to a hypothetical feature implementation:

```markdown
# User Notification System Implementation Plan for Reliquary Application

This document outlines the detailed plan for implementing a notification system in the Reliquary application. The notification system will allow users to receive alerts about changes to relics they follow, system announcements, and other important events.

The system will support:
- Email notifications
- In-app notifications
- Optional SMS notifications (future enhancement)

## General Setup

Before implementing specific components, we need to set up the notification infrastructure:

1. **Create Notification Entity and Repository**
   - Create `src/Entity/Notification.php`
   - Create `src/Repository/NotificationRepository.php`

2. **Set Up Message Queue System**
   - Install Symfony Messenger component
   ```bash
   composer require symfony/messenger
   ```
   - Configure message transport in `config/packages/messenger.yaml`

3. **Update Database Schema**
   ```bash
   php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force
   ```

## Component-Specific Implementation Plans

### 1. NotificationController

#### Files to Create/Update:
- `src/Controller/NotificationController.php`
- `templates/notification/index.html.twig`
- `templates/notification/_notification_item.html.twig`
- `templates/notification/preferences.html.twig`

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Create controller with actions for listing notifications and managing preferences
2. Create templates for displaying notifications
3. Implement notification marking as read functionality

### 2. NotificationService

#### Files to Create:
- `src/Service/NotificationService.php`
- `src/Message/NotificationMessage.php`
- `src/MessageHandler/NotificationMessageHandler.php`

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Create service for sending notifications
2. Implement message and handler for async processing
3. Add methods for different notification types

### 3. Email Templates

#### Files to Create:
- `templates/emails/notification.html.twig`
- `templates/emails/notification.txt.twig`

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Create HTML and text email templates
2. Implement responsive design for email templates

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1: Core Infrastructure**
   - Set up database entities and repositories
   - Configure message queue system
   - Create basic notification service

2. **Week 2: User Interface**
   - Implement notification controller
   - Create notification templates
   - Add notification preferences UI

3. **Week 3: Integration**
   - Connect notification triggers to existing features
   - Implement email sending functionality
   - Add notification badge to main navigation

4. **Week 4: Testing and Refinement**
   - Test notification flow end-to-end
   - Optimize performance for high-volume notifications
   - Add missing notification types

## Testing Strategy

1. **Manual Testing**
   - Test notification creation through various triggers
   - Verify email delivery and formatting
   - Test notification preferences and opt-out functionality

2. **Automated Testing**
   - Unit tests for NotificationService
   - Functional tests for NotificationController
   - Integration tests for notification triggers

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Sending a Notification from a Controller**
   ```php
   // Example of sending a notification
   $this->notificationService->notify(
       $user,
       'relic_updated',
       ['relic' => $relic],
       ['email' => true, 'inApp' => true]
   );
   ```

2. **Displaying Notification Count in Templates**
   ```twig
   {# Display unread notification count #}
   <span class="badge bg-danger">
       {{ notification_service.getUnreadCount(app.user) }}
   </span>
   ```

## Maintenance Considerations

1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Monitor queue length for notification processing
   - Set up alerts for failed notification deliveries
   - Implement batch processing for high-volume notifications

2. **Data Management**
   - Implement automatic purging of old notifications
   - Consider archiving important notifications
   - Add database indexes for notification queries

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - SMS notification support
   - Push notifications for mobile app
   - Rich content in notifications
```

## Adapting the Structure

While this structure provides a comprehensive template, it can be adapted based on the specific needs of the implementation:

1. For smaller features, some sections may be condensed or combined
2. For complex features, additional sections may be needed
3. The level of detail in code examples should match the complexity of the implementation

## Benefits of Following This Structure

1. **Consistency**: All implementation plans follow the same format, making them easier to review and understand
2. **Completeness**: The structure ensures all important aspects of implementation are considered
3. **Clarity**: Clear separation of concerns makes it easier to assign work and track progress
4. **Documentation**: The plan serves as documentation for the implemented feature
5. **Maintenance**: Future developers can understand the original implementation plan
